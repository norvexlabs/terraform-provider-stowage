The provider's releases. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions
follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- `stowage_install` on a Docker host, reached over SSH with its host key pinned or on the machine
  running OpenTofu: create (the installer fetched on the target by digest, its `describe` read,
  the install run unattended), read (`status --json`, the release that runs replacing the one
  configured) and delete (refused while `deletion_protection`; `delete_data` deletes the volumes).
- Secret inputs, a handoff's given values and a secrets export as write-only attributes, sent to
  the target on standard input, never on a command line or in state.
- The installer's refusals as diagnostics naming the fix; an installer of an unknown machine
  interface format refused.
- First-install-only settings changed: a plan-time error, never a replacement.
- The Kubernetes and VM targets' schema (not yet installed).
